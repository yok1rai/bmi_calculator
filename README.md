BMI Calculator Python Program
Overview

This Python program calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user’s weight and height and provides a health category along with recommendations. It uses Python 3.10+ match-case syntax for clean conditional logic and supports continuous input for multiple calculations.

What is BMI?

Formula:

BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ** 2)
